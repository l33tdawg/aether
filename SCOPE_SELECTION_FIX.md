# Scope Selection Fix - Why You Saw "1 contract" Instead of "6 contracts"

## 🔍 What You Discovered

You have **TWO separate completed scopes** in your database:

```
Scope 11 (Most Recent): 
  - Created: 06:09:05
  - Completed: 06:09:23
  - Contracts: 1 (NoDelegateCall.sol)

Scope 10 (Older):
  - Created: 03:18:04
  - Completed: 03:58:02  
  - Contracts: 6 (UniswapV3Pool, UniswapV3Factory, etc.)
```

## 🐛 The Old Behavior (What You Saw)

**Resume menu only showed the MOST RECENT scope:**
- You saw "1 contract" because that's what's in Scope 11
- The older Scope 10 with 6 contracts was hidden
- No way to access or work with older scopes

**Report generation showed ALL scopes combined:**
- "7 total contracts" = 6 from Scope 10 + 1 from Scope 11
- This caused confusion - numbers didn't match the resume menu

## ✅ The New Behavior (What's Fixed)

**Now you'll see a scope selection menu:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📋 MULTIPLE AUDIT SCOPES FOUND
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Select a scope to work with:

  [1] ✅ Scope_1761199745
       Created: 2025-10-23 06:09:05
       Status: COMPLETED
       Contracts: 1/1 audited

  [2] ✅ Scope_1761189484
       Created: 2025-10-23 03:18:04
       Status: COMPLETED
       Contracts: 6/6 audited

  [0] Create new scope

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Select scope (0 to create new):
```

**After selecting a scope, you get the options menu:**
```
What would you like to do?

  [1] View audit report for this scope
  [2] Add more contracts to this scope (reactivates scope)
  [3] Re-audit all contracts (fresh analysis)
  [4] Create new scope with different contracts
  [5] Cancel (exit)
```

## 📝 What Got Added

### New Methods:

**database_manager.py:**
- `get_all_scopes(project_id)` - Retrieves ALL scopes for a project
- `reactivate_scope(scope_id)` - Changes completed → active status

**scope_manager.py:**
- `_select_scope_from_multiple(scopes, contracts)` - Shows selection menu
- Enhanced `detect_and_handle_saved_scope()` - Handles multiple scopes

## 🎯 Use Cases

## 🚀 Try It Now

```bash
python3 main.py audit https://github.com/sushiswap/v3-core --enhanced --interactive-scope
```

**You should now see:**
