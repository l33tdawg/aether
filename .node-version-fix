# Quick Fix: Slither Node.js Issue

## TL;DR
Slither was failing because Node.js v20 doesn't work with Hardhat. Upgrade to Node v22:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
nvm alias default 22
```

Or run:
```bash
./scripts/setup_node.sh
```

## What Changed
âœ… Auto-detects and uses Node 22 for Slither analysis
âœ… Better error messages when Node version is wrong
âœ… Setup script now checks Node version
âœ… Helper script for easy Node 22 setup
âœ… Documentation updated with requirements

## Verify Fix
```bash
python setup.py  # Should show Node 22 installed
```

Done! ðŸŽ‰
